# 7tsp-Icon-themes

7tsp icon themes for Windows as well as some extras.  Please read the guide prior to installation.

To install this icon pack you need to use [7TSP GUI 2019 Edition](https://www.deviantart.com/devillnside/art/7TSP-GUI-2019-Edition-804769422).

Installation:
Open up 7TSP & click Add a Custom Pack & select the icon pack you want to install.
Click on Start Patching.
By default 7TSP will create a restore point & install the icon pack.
Once installation is complete reboot & you're done.

Requirements:
***Windows 10 Builds 1903 - Windows 11 current builds.***

For a cleaner look use the [Folder Thumbnail Remover.zip](https://github.com/niivu/7tsp-Icon-themes/files/8693004/Folder.Thumbnail.Remover.zip) registry hack.
